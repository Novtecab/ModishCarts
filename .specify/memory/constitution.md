# ModishCarts Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Clean, maintainable, and readable code is paramount**
- All code must follow established linting rules and formatting standards
- Code complexity must be minimized - functions should have single responsibilities
- Magic numbers and strings are prohibited - use named constants
- All public APIs require comprehensive documentation with examples
- Dead code and unused dependencies must be removed during each PR
- Code reviews are mandatory - no self-merging allowed
- Naming conventions must be consistent and descriptive across the entire codebase

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Comprehensive testing ensures reliability and confidence**
- TDD cycle strictly enforced: Red (write failing test) → Green (make it pass) → Refactor
- Minimum 90% code coverage required for all new features
- Unit tests must be isolated, fast, and deterministic
- Integration tests required for all API endpoints and external service interactions
- End-to-end tests mandatory for critical user journeys
- Test names must clearly describe the scenario and expected outcome
- Mocking and stubbing preferred over real external dependencies in unit tests
- Performance testing required for all data-heavy operations

### III. User Experience Consistency
**Seamless and intuitive user interactions across all touchpoints**
- Design system components must be used consistently - no one-off implementations
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) are mandatory, not optional
- Mobile-first responsive design approach required for all interfaces
- Loading states, error handling, and user feedback must be consistent
- User flows must be validated through usability testing before implementation
- Progressive enhancement - core functionality works without JavaScript
- Internationalization support built-in from the start
- User preferences and settings must persist across sessions

### IV. Performance Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Fast, efficient, and scalable applications**
- Page load times must not exceed 2 seconds on 3G networks
- Time to First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.5 seconds
- Core Web Vitals must meet "Good" thresholds (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- Database queries must be optimized - no N+1 queries allowed
- Images must be optimized and served in modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Code splitting and lazy loading mandatory for large applications
- Memory leaks are not acceptable - proper cleanup required
- API response times must not exceed 500ms for standard operations

### V. Security and Data Protection
**User trust through robust security measures**
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Authentication and authorization implemented according to industry standards
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and dependency vulnerability scans
- No secrets or credentials in source code
- HTTPS enforced for all communications
- Data retention policies clearly defined and implemented

## Quality Gates and Standards

### Code Review Process
- All changes require approval from at least one senior developer
- Automated checks must pass: linting, testing, security scans
- Performance impact assessment required for significant changes
- Documentation updates mandatory for API or behavior changes
- Breaking changes require migration guides and deprecation notices

### Testing Standards
- Unit test suites must complete in under 30 seconds
- Integration tests should complete in under 5 minutes
- Flaky tests are not tolerated - fix or remove immediately
- Test data must be isolated and not affect other tests
- Continuous integration pipeline must include all test types

### Performance Monitoring
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) implemented for production applications
- Performance budgets enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular performance audits conducted monthly
- Alerting configured for performance degradation
- Optimization opportunities tracked and prioritized

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Feature specifications must be approved before development begins
2. Technical design review required for complex features
3. Implementation must follow the Test-Driven Development cycle
4. Code review and approval required before merging
5. Feature flags used for gradual rollouts of significant changes

### Quality Assurance
- Automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, e2e)
- Manual testing for user experience validation
- Performance testing for all new features
- Security testing integrated into the development pipeline
- Accessibility testing with real assistive technologies

### Deployment Standards
- Staging environment must mirror production exactly
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases
- Rollback procedures tested and documented
- Database migrations must be backward compatible
- Feature toggles available for immediate issue resolution

## Governance

**This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines**

- All pull requests must demonstrate compliance with these principles
- Non-compliance blocks merge - no exceptions for deadlines
- Regular constitution reviews scheduled quarterly
- Amendments require team consensus and documentation
- Metrics tracked for each principle to ensure adherence
- Training provided to ensure team understanding and capability

**Enforcement**: Automated tooling validates compliance where possible. Human oversight ensures spirit of principles is maintained alongside technical requirements.
