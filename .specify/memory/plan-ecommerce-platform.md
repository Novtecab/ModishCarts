## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Design
Based on specification entities, the following models will be created:

#### Core Entities
- **User**: Authentication and profile management
- **Product**: Catalog items with variants and inventory
- **Category**: Product organization and navigation
- **Cart**: Session-based shopping cart management
- **Order**: Purchase transactions and fulfillment
- **Payment**: Financial transaction records
- **Review**: Customer feedback and ratings

### API Contract Generation
REST API contracts will be generated for:

1. **Authentication API** (`/contracts/auth.openapi.yml`)
   - POST /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/logout
   - GET /auth/me, /auth/refresh

2. **Products API** (`/contracts/products.openapi.yml`)
   - GET /products (with filtering, pagination, search)
   - GET /products/:id
   - POST /products (admin), PUT /products/:id (admin)

3. **Cart API** (`/contracts/cart.openapi.yml`)
   - GET /cart, POST /cart/items, PUT /cart/items/:id, DELETE /cart/items/:id

4. **Orders API** (`/contracts/orders.openapi.yml`)
   - POST /orders, GET /orders, GET /orders/:id
   - PUT /orders/:id/cancel

5. **Payments API** (`/contracts/payments.openapi.yml`)
   - POST /payments/intent, POST /payments/confirm
   - POST /webhooks/stripe

### Contract Test Generation
Each API endpoint will have corresponding contract tests that:
- Validate request/response schemas
- Test authentication requirements
- Verify error handling
- Ensure proper HTTP status codes

### Quickstart Development Guide
A comprehensive development setup guide will be created covering:
- Environment setup and dependencies
- Database setup and seeding
- Local development workflow
- Testing procedures
- Deployment process

### Agent Context Update
The GitHub Copilot instructions file will be updated with:
- Technology stack context
- Coding standards and patterns
- Common tasks and workflows
- Architecture decisions and rationale

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/* OpenAPI specs, failing contract tests, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base template
- Generate implementation tasks from Phase 1 design documents
- Each API contract → contract test task [P] (can be implemented in parallel)
- Each database model → model creation and validation task [P]
- Each user story from specification → integration test task
- Implementation tasks ordered to make tests pass (TDD approach)

**Task Categories**:
1. **Infrastructure Setup** (5-7 tasks)
   - Development environment configuration
   - Database setup and schema creation
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Hosting platform setup

2. **Backend Development** (15-20 tasks)
   - Database models and migrations
   - API endpoints and business logic
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Payment processing integration
   - Admin functionality

3. **Frontend Development** (15-20 tasks)
   - Component library setup
   - Page implementations
   - State management
   - Shopping cart functionality
   - Checkout flow

4. **Integration & Testing** (8-10 tasks)
   - API integration tests
   - End-to-end user journey tests
   - Performance optimization
   - Security testing

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure and database setup
- **Phase 2**: Backend API development (following TDD)
- **Phase 3**: Frontend implementation with API integration
- **Phase 4**: End-to-end integration and optimization

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 numbered, prioritized tasks in tasks.md with clear dependencies and parallel execution markers [P]

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan
