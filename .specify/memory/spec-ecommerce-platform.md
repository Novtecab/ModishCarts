## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a customer, I want to browse products online, add items I like to my shopping cart, and securely purchase them with my preferred payment method, so that I can conveniently shop from home and receive the products I need.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the store homepage, **When** I browse the product catalog, **Then** I can see all available products with images, prices, and basic information
2. **Given** I find a product I want, **When** I click "Add to Cart", **Then** the item is added to my cart and cart count updates
3. **Given** I have items in my cart, **When** I proceed to checkout, **Then** I can review my order and enter payment information
4. **Given** I complete payment information, **When** I submit my order, **Then** I receive order confirmation and payment is processed
5. **Given** I am a store administrator, **When** I access the admin panel, **Then** I can manage product inventory, view orders, and update product information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a product goes out of stock while it's in a customer's cart?
- How does the system handle payment failures or declined cards?
- What occurs when a customer abandons their cart midway through checkout?
- How are product price changes handled for items already in carts?
- What happens when the same customer logs in from multiple devices?
