## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Development Phase (6 weeks)
- **Total Development Cost**: ~$50 maximum
- **Primary Costs**: Stripe (free during development), Cloudinary (free tier)

### Production Launch (Monthly)
- **Vercel Pro**: $20/month
- **Railway**: $10-20/month (database + backend)
- **Cloudinary**: $0-10/month
- **Monitoring**: $0-10/month
- **Total**: $30-60/month for 1K-10K users

### Scaling Projections
- **10K+ users**: ~$100-200/month
- **50K+ users**: ~$500-1000/month  
- **100K+ users**: Migration to dedicated infrastructure

## üöÄ Ready for Next Phase

### Generated Artifacts
1. **Complete technical specification** with all architectural decisions documented
2. **Detailed data model** with PostgreSQL schema and relationships
3. **API contracts** defining all endpoint specifications
4. **Development environment** setup with comprehensive tooling
5. **Testing strategy** covering unit, integration, and E2E testing
6. **Deployment plan** with staging and production workflows

### Next Command Available
**`/tasks`** - Generate detailed implementation tasks from this plan
