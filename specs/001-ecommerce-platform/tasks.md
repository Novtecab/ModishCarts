# Tasks: ModishCarts E-commerce Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ecommerce-platform/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Loaded: ModishCarts implementation plan with Next.js + Express.js + PostgreSQL
   → Extracted: Modern JAMstack architecture, Prisma ORM, TypeScript throughout
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extracted 8 entities (User, Product, Category, Order, etc.)
   → contracts/: products.openapi.yml → 5 endpoint contract tests
   → research.md: Technology stack decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project initialization, dependencies, tooling configuration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD approach)
   → Core: database models, services, API endpoints
   → Integration: authentication, payments, frontend components
   → Polish: E2E tests, performance optimization, deployment
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = marked [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P] marker)
   → Tests before implementation (TDD constitutional requirement)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T048)
6. Generate dependency graph with clear blocking relationships
7. Create parallel execution examples for efficient development
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have corresponding tests ✅
   → All entities have model creation tasks ✅
   → All endpoints have implementation tasks ✅
9. Return: SUCCESS (48 tasks ready for 6-week execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Paths follow implementation plan structure
- Clear separation between frontend and backend tasks

## Dependencies

### Critical Blocking Relationships
- **Tests → Implementation**: T013-T026 must complete and FAIL before T027-T037
- **Backend → Frontend**: T027-T037 must complete before T046-T051 
- **Core → Advanced**: T027-T051 must complete before T052-T058
- **Integration → Polish**: T059-T065 must complete before T066-T078

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **T002-T007**: All setup tasks can run simultaneously
- **T013-T021**: All contract tests are independent
- **T022-T026**: All integration tests are independent  
- **T027-T032**: All model/service pairs are independent
- **T039-T041**: UI components can be built in parallel
- **T043-T045**: State management setup is independent

---

- ✅ **Contract tests ensure API compliance** (OpenAPI spec validation)
- ✅ **Integration tests validate user stories** (Complete user journeys)
- ✅ **90% coverage achievable** with comprehensive test suite

### Code Quality Standards
- ✅ **TypeScript strict mode** enforced in setup tasks
- ✅ **ESLint + Prettier** configured for consistency
- ✅ **File path specificity** ensures no conflicts
- ✅ **Clear separation of concerns** (models → services → controllers)

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ **<2s load times** addressed in T066-T068 optimization tasks
- ✅ **<500ms API responses** ensured by T067 database optimization
- ✅ **Core Web Vitals** validated in T077 performance audits

### Security Implementation
- ✅ **Authentication/Authorization** implemented in T042, T059
- ✅ **Input validation** enforced in T060
- ✅ **Rate limiting** implemented in T061
- ✅ **Stripe PCI compliance** built into T037, T056

## Task Generation Rules Applied

### From Contracts (products.openapi.yml)
- ✅ **5 contract endpoints** → 5 contract test tasks (T013-T017)
- ✅ **Each endpoint** → corresponding implementation task (T034)

### From Data Model (8 entities)
- ✅ **Each entity** → model creation task [P] (T027-T032)
- ✅ **Service relationships** → business logic tasks (T027-T032)

### From User Stories (specification)
- ✅ **Registration flow** → integration test (T022)
- ✅ **Product browsing** → integration test (T023)
- ✅ **Shopping cart** → integration test (T024)
- ✅ **Order creation** → integration test (T025)
- ✅ **Payment processing** → integration test (T026)

### Ordering Strategy Applied
- ✅ **Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish**
- ✅ **TDD cycle strictly enforced** (Red → Green → Refactor)
- ✅ **Dependencies clearly mapped** with blocking relationships
- ✅ **Parallel opportunities maximized** for efficient development

---

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- ✅ **All contracts have corresponding tests** (T013-T017 for products API)
- ✅ **All entities have model tasks** (T027-T032 for 8 database entities)
- ✅ **All tests come before implementation** (T013-T026 before T027-T037)
- ✅ **Parallel tasks truly independent** ([P] tasks use different files)
- ✅ **Each task specifies exact file path** (Clear implementation guidance)
- ✅ **No task modifies same file as another [P] task** (Conflict prevention)
